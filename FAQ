About Yioop/SeekQuarry
======================
Q: Where does the name Yioop come from?

A: I was looking for names that hadn't already been registered. My
wife is Vietnamese so I thought I might have better luck with
Vietnamese words since all the English ones seemed to be taken.
I started with the word giup, which is the way to spell 'help'
in Vietnamese if you remove the accents. It was already taken.
Then I tried yoop, which is my lame way of pronouncing how
giup sounds like in English. It was already taken. So then I
combined the two to get Yioop.

Q: What is the relationship between Yioop and SeekQuarry?

A: When looking for names for my search engine I was originally
thinking about using the name SeekQuarry which also hadn't been
registered. After deciding that I would use Yioop for the name
of my search engine site, I decided I would use SeekQuarry as a
site to publish the software that is used in the Yioop engine.
That is, yioop.com is a live site that demonstrates the open 
source search engine software distributed on the seekquarry.com
site.
