Installation
-------------
(1) You need to edit the files config.php and seedsites.php 
in the configs folder. You should set these up with values 
which work for your system and for which sites you would 
initially like to crawl.

(2) You also need to set up the basic database, by running the 
createdb.php scripts in the configs 
folder:
php createdb.php

(3) To start the queue server you type:

php queue_server.php

from the bin folder. 

(4) You need at least one fetcher running
to download pages. You can set fetchers up either on the
same machine or on other machines. The QUEUE_SERVER
in config.php says the url of the server to get fetch batches
from. To run a fetcher, simply type:

php fetcher.php

from the bin folder.

(5) To start a crawl, you need to point your browser at the url
of your seek_quarry installation. Click on the admin link,
then the manage crawl link. Type in a description of your
crawl and click "Start New Crawl". After about a minute you should
start the Currently Processing and Most Recent Urls sections updating
with info about the current crawl. 

(6) After running your crawl for a while you can click the Stop
button to stop it. The crawl should show up after a delay in the
Previous Crawls table. Their you can choose to resume a crawl,
delete it, or set it as the current index.

(7) If you set a crawl as the current index. Then when you go
back to your installations web page and type a query in the search bar,
the query will be answered with the results from that crawl.

One potential problem you might have is that you have multiple
versions of php and or mysql installed. If this is the case,
you need to make sure the command line version of php knows
about the particular mysql dbms where you are storing
the SeekQuarry database. This might involve reordering the 
directories listed in your path environment variable.
