/**
 * The primary interface for building and using classifiers. An instance of
 * this class represents a single classifier in memory, but the class also
 * provides static methods to manage classifiers on disk.
 *
 * A single classifier is a tool for determining the likelihood that a document
 * is a positive instance of a particular class. In order to do this, a
 * classifier goes through a training phase on a labeled training set where it
 * learns weights for document features (terms, for our purposes). To classify
 * a new document, the learned weights for all terms in the document are
 * combined in order to yield a pdeudo-probability that the document belongs to
 * the class.
 *
 * A classifier is composed of a candidate buffer, a training set, a set of
 * features, and a classification algorithm. In addition to the set of all
 * features, there is a restricted set of features used for training and
 * classification. There are also two classification algorithms: a Naive Bayes
 * algorithm used during labeling, and a logistic regression algorithm used to
 * train the final classifier. In general, a fresh classifier will first go
 * through a labeling phase where a collection of labeled training documents is
 * built up out of existing crawl indexes, and then a finalization phase where
 * the logistic regression algorithm will be trained on the training set
 * established in the first phase. After finalization, the classifier may be
 * used to classify new web pages during a crawl.
 *
 * During the labeling phase, the classifier fills a buffer of candidate pages
 * from the user-selected index (optionally restricted by a query), and tries
 * to pick the best one to present to the user to be labeled (here `best' means
 * the one that, once labeled, is most likely to improve classification
 * accuracy). Each labeled document is removed from the buffer, converted to a
 * feature vector (described next), and added to the training set. The expanded
 * training set is then used to train an intermediate Naive Bayes
 * classification algorithm that is in turn used to more accurately identify
 * good candidates for the next round of labeling. This phase continues until
 * the user gets tired of labeling documents, or is happy with the estimated
 * classification accuracy.
 *
 * Instead of passing around terms everywhere, each document that goes into the
 * training set is first mapped through a Features instance that maps terms to
 * feature indices (e.g. "Pythagorean" => 1, "theorem" => 2, etc.). These
 * feature indices are used internally by the classification algorithms, and by
 * the algorithms that try to pick out the most informative features. In
 * addition to keeping track of the mapping between terms and feature indices,
 * a Features instance keeps term and label statistics (such as how often a
 * term occurs in documents with a particular label) used to weight features
 * within a document and to select informative features. Finally, subclasses of
 * the Features class weight features in different ways, presenting more or
 * less of everything that's known about the frequency or informativeness of a
 * feature to classification algorithms.
 *
 * Once a sufficiently-useful training set has been built, a FeatureSelection
 * instance is used to choose the most informative features, and copy these
 * into a reduced Features instance that has a much smaller vocabulary, and
 * thus a much smaller memory footprint. For efficiency, this is the Features
 * instance used to train classification algorithms, and to classify web pages.
 * Finalization is just the process of training a logistic regression
 * classification algorithm on the full training set. This results in a set of
 * feature weights that can be used to efficiently assign a psuedo-probability
 * to the proposition that a new web page is a positive instance of the class
 * that the classifier has been trained to recognize. Training logistic
 * regression on a large training set can take a long time, so this phase is
 * carried out asynchronously, by a daemon launched in response to the
 * finalization request.
 *
 * Because the full Features instance, buffer, and training set are only needed
 * during the labeling and finalization phases, and because they can get very
 * large and take up a lot of space in memory, this class separates its large
 * instance members into separate files when serializing to disk. When a
 * classifier is first loaded into memory from disk it brings along only its
 * summary statistics, since these are all that are needed to, for example,
 * display a list of classifiers. In order to actually add new documents to the
 * training set, finalize, or classify, the classifier must first be explicitly
 * told to load the relevant data structures from disk; this is accomplished by
 * methods like prepareToLabel and prepareToClassify.  These methods load in
 * the relevant serialized structures, and mark the associated data members for
 * storage back to disk when (or if) the classifier is serialized again.
