/**
 * Base indexing plugin Class. An indexing plugin allows a developer
 * to do additional processing on web pages during a crawl, then after
 * the web crawl is over do post processing on the additional data
 * that was collected. For example, during a crawl one might by analysing
 * web pages mark pages that have recipes on them with the meta word
 * recipe:all, then after the crawl is over do post processing such
 * as clustering the recipe's found and add additional meta words to
 * retrieve recipe's by principle ingredient.
 *
 * Yioop comes included with two example subclasses of IndexingPlugins to
 * illustrate how to write plugins: recipe_plugin.php and word_filter.php.
 *
 * Subclasses of IndexingPlugin typically override some of the following four
 * methods:
 *
 * static getProcessors() -- returns an array of strings of page processor names
 *      which a plugin should be used with. For example, a plugin might want to
 *      alter the summary whenever an HtmlProcessor is used on a page, so
 *      this array should contain HtmlProcessor, but on the other hand, the
 *      plugin might not need to alter anything when the JpgProcessor is in use,
 *      so the returned array shouldn't contain JpgProcessor
 *
 * pageProcessing($page, $url) -- which is called by a page processor
 *     when a page is being processed. It returns additional subdoc page summary
 *     info which is then handed back to the fetcher (@see pageProcessing method
 *     below for more info.)
 *
 * pageSummaryProcessing(&$summary) -- which is called by a page processor in a
 *     fetcher after the initial summary has been generated (by processor itself
 *     and all plugins which are associated with the processor). This method can
 *     be used to further modify the summary
 *
 * getAdditionalMetaWords() -- which is called when meta words are extracted
 *      from a query at search time. This allows the plugin to specify its own
 *      meta words to be extracted from the query. @see getAdditionalMetaWords
 *      for more details on the return type of this method.
 *
 * If you would like to write a plugin which can be configured on the
 * Admin > Page Options page, then you need to write four other methods:
 *
 * loadConfiguration() -- which can read plugin configuration data from
 *     persistent storage on the name server into an array or object when a
 *     crawl is started. This data is then automatically serialized and sent to
 *     queue servers as part of starting a crawl
 *
 * setConfiguration() -- which takes a configuration array or object and uses
 *      it to initialize an instance of the plugin on a queue_server or on a
 *      fetcher.
 *
 * configureHandler(&$data) -- which is called by the AdminController
 *      pageOptions activity method to let the plugin handle any configuration
 *      $_REQUEST data sent by this activity with regard to the plugin and to
 *      also let plugin modify the $data which might be sent to the plugin's
 *      view. This method would typically be called on the name server and
 *      so can be used to save (or to call a method which saves) any
 *      configuration data extracted from the request.
 *
 * configureView(&$data) -- which is called to draw the HTML configure screen
 *      used by the plugin given the information in &$data. This might display
 *      a form a user would use to alter the behavior of the plugin
 *
 * Subclasses of IndexingPlugin stored in
 *      WORK_DIRECTORY/app/lib/indexing_plugins
 * will be detected by Yioop. So one can add code there to make it easier
 * to upgrade Yioop. I.e., your site specific code can stay in the work
 * directory and you merely need to replace the Yioop folder when upgrading.
